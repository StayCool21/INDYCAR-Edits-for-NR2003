# INDYCAR-Edits-for-NR2003

Hello all,

I'd like to start that I've been a fan of NASCAR Racing 2003 Season (NR2003) for around 5 years now. I've been around the various NR2003 websites for a handful of years and it's amazing to see the ways in which this game has grown, considering it's been around for 20 years now. 

Because NASCAR's current situation with the developers of a new game (i.e. Motorsport Games) is in a very precarious situation, I decided I should try to do my part to keep this game going, even if my first project here isn't quite NASCAR-related. But...we haven't seen an INDYCAR game in quite a long time either, and it's up in the air whether that game--when it supposedly comes out--will deliver.

So here we go...
