# INDYCAR-Edits-for-NR2003

Hello all,

I'd like to start that I've been a fan of NASCAR Racing 2003 Season (NR2003) for around 5 years now. I've been around the various NR2003 websites for a handful of years and it's amazing to see the ways in which this game has grown, considering it's been around for 20 years now. 

Because NASCAR's current situation with the developers of a new game (i.e. Motorsport Games) is in a very precarious situation, I decided I should try to do my part to keep this game going, even if my first project here isn't quite NASCAR-related. But...we haven't seen an INDYCAR game in quite a long time either, and it's up in the air whether that game--when it supposedly comes out--will deliver. Hopefully this first project will allow more enjoyment of the great open-wheel mods talented modders have designed. The way I see it, we need to share as many projects as we can to keep this game alive.

So here we go...

## The Basics


This .exe release has two different open-wheel physics: one that is a CART-like open-wheeler, and one that attempts to follow some of the specs from present-day INDYCAR.

Features:

1. Added amounts of downforce to the cars. There's probably a little too much to simulate a present-day INDYCAR for the first "CART" EXE, but the second one should at least somewhat represent a 2023 INDYCAR. In most cases, both EXEs should provide a decent amount of grip **without any necessary increases to the surface grip of tracks in the game.** In fact, you probably will need to decrease many of your favorite track's grip settings, especially if they have a specific section for pta physiscs.

2. Decreased weight. 

3. Engine changes. In both EXEs, I added more torque and an increased redline of 11,500 RPM. The added torque should give quite a bit more acceleration than the traditional pta physics.

4. Ride height increases. With the normal pta physics, there was a lot of clipping going on, especially on high-banked ovals. You should be able to change both front and rear heights to higher values to alleviate some of this issue. Some clipping still may occur, however.

## Installation Instructions

1. Drag and drop the physics you like into the base folder of NR2003. You will need the pta physics to be installed previously in order for this to work, as well as the INDYCAR mod you want to play with.

2. Copy the setup files from the tracks folder into the track's folder you want to use. I hope to add more of these later. Feel free to develop a good setup for your own favorite track.

As long as you do these two steps, you should be good to go with these new physics!

## Known Issues

Unless you do some heavy editing with the track's AI settings, most tracks **will not work with these physics**, at least on a consistent basis. As of right now, I haven't had much time to dial in any racing with the AI, but you should still be able to have fun in track testing. If anyone wants to help to get AI racing more acceptable, feel free to do so or contact me on Reddit.

## Closing Thoughts...

Feel free to edit these EXEs, CSV files, setups, or anything else from this release. I only ask that if you do create any new physics similar to this and release it on a website similar to this **that you give credit to me (StayCool21)**. I truly believe that the only way we as a community can continue to grow this game if we create as many new and exciting things for people to try out.

If you have any further questions about what I did or anything else related to NR2003, please message me. I'm always happy to help.


Have fun racing,
