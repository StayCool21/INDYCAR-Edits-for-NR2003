# INDYCAR-Edits-for-NR2003

Hello all,

I'd like to start that I've been a fan of NASCAR Racing 2003 Season (NR2003) for around 5 years now. I've been around the various NR2003 websites for a handful of years and it's amazing to see the ways in which this game has grown, considering it's been around for 20 years now. 

Because NASCAR's current situation with the developers of a new game (i.e. Motorsport Games) is in a very precarious situation, I decided I should try to do my part to keep this game going, even if my first project here isn't quite NASCAR-related. But...we haven't seen an INDYCAR game in quite a long time either, and it's up in the air whether that game--when it supposedly comes out--will deliver. Hopefully this first project will allow more enjoyment of the great open-wheel mods talented modders have designed. The way I see it, we need to share as many projects as we can to keep this game alive.

So here we go...

## The Basics


This .exe release has two different open-wheel physics: one that is a CART-like open-wheeler, and one that attempts to follow some of the specs from present-day INDYCAR.

Features:

1. Added amounts of downforce to the cars. There's probably a little too much to simulate a present-day INDYCAR for the first "CART" EXE, but the second one should at least somewhat represent a 2023 INDYCAR. In most cases, both EXEs should provide a decent amount of grip **without any necessary increases to the surface grip of tracks in the game.** In fact, you probably will need to decrease many of your favorite track's grip settings, especially if they have a specific section for pta physiscs.

2. Decreased weight. 

3. Engine changes. In both EXEs, I added more torque and an increased redline of
